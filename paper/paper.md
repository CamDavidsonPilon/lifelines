# Summary

*lifelines* is a pure Python implementation of the most common statistical models in survival analysis. It's value comes from it's intuitive and well documented API, it's extensibility, it's flexibility in modeling novel hazard functions, and it's easy deployment in production systems & research stations along side other Python libraries. The internals of *lifelines* uses some novel approaches to survival analysis algorithms like automatic differentiation and meta-algorithms.
