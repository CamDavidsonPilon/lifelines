Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

0.18.6
^^^^^^

-  some improvements to the output of ``check_assumptions``.
   ``show_plots`` is turned to ``False`` by default now. It only shows
   ``rank`` and ``km`` p-values now.
-  some performance improvements to ``qth_survival_time``.

.. _section-1:

0.18.5
^^^^^^

-  added new plotting methods to parametric univariate models:
   ``plot_survival_function``, ``plot_hazard`` and
   ``plot_cumulative_hazard``. The last one is an alias for ``plot``.
-  added new properties to parametric univarite models:
   ``confidence_interval_survival_function_``,
   ``confidence_interval_hazard_``,
   ``confidence_interval_cumulative_hazard_``. The last one is an alias
   for ``confidence_interval_``.
-  Fixed some overflow issues with ``AalenJohansenFitter``\ ‚Äôs variance
   calculations when using large datasets.
-  Fixed an edgecase in ``AalenJohansenFitter`` that causing some
   datasets with to be jittered too often.
-  Add a new kwarg to ``AalenJohansenFitter``, ``calculate_variance``
   that can be used to turn off variance calculations since this can
   take a long time for large datasets. Thanks @pzivich!

.. _section-2:

0.18.4
^^^^^^

-  fixed confidence intervals in cumulative hazards for parametric
   univarite models. They were previously serverly depressed.
-  adding left-truncation support to parametric univarite models with
   the ``entry`` kwarg in ``.fit``

.. _section-3:

0.18.3
^^^^^^

-  Some performance improvements to parametric univariate models.
-  Suppressing some irrelevant NumPy and autograd warnings, so lifeline
   warnings are more noticeable.
-  Improved some warning and error messages.

.. _section-4:

0.18.2
^^^^^^

-  New univariate fitter ``PiecewiseExponentialFitter`` for creating a
   stepwise hazard model. See docs online.
-  Ability to create novel parametric univariate models using the new
   ``ParametericUnivariateFitter`` super class. See docs online for how
   to do this.
-  Unfortunately, parametric univariate fitters are not serializable
   with ``pickle``. The library ``dill`` is still useable.
-  Complete overhaul of all internals for parametric univariate fitters.
   Moved them all (most) to use ``autograd``.
-  ``LogNormalFitter`` no longer models ``log_sigma``.

.. _section-5:

0.18.1
^^^^^^

-  bug fixes in ``LogNormalFitter`` variance estimates
-  improve convergence of ``LogNormalFitter``. We now model the log of
   sigma internally, but still expose sigma externally.
-  use the ``autograd`` lib to help with gradients.
-  New ``LogLogisticFitter`` univariate fitter available.

.. _section-6:

0.18.0
^^^^^^

-  ``LogNormalFitter`` is a new univariate fitter you can use.
-  ``WeibullFitter`` now correctly returns the confidence intervals
   (previously returned only NaNs)
-  ``WeibullFitter.print_summary()`` displays p-values associated with
   its parameters not equal to 1.0 - previously this was (implicitly)
   comparing against 0, which is trivially always true (the parameters
   must be greater than 0)
-  ``ExponentialFitter.print_summary()`` displays p-values associated
   with its parameters not equal to 1.0 - previously this was
   (implicitly) comparing against 0, which is trivially always true (the
   parameters must be greater than 0)
-  ``ExponentialFitter.plot`` now displays the cumulative hazard,
   instead of the survival function. This is to make it easier to
   compare to ``WeibullFitter`` and ``LogNormalFitter``
-  Univariate fitters‚Äô ``cumulative_hazard_at_times``,
   ``hazard_at_times``, ``survival_function_at_times`` return pandas
   Series now (use to be numpy arrays)
-  remove ``alpha`` keyword from all statistical functions. This was
   never being used.
-  Gone are astericks and dots in ``print_summary`` functions that
   represent signficance thresholds.
-  In models‚Äô ``summary`` (including ``print_summary``), the ``log(p)``
   term has changed to ``-log2(p)``. This is known as the s-value. See
   https://lesslikely.com/statistics/s-values/
-  introduce new statistical tests between univariate datasets:
   ``survival_difference_at_fixed_point_in_time_test``,‚Ä¶
-  new warning message when Cox models detects possible non-unique
   solutions to maximum likelihood.
-  Generally: clean up lifelines exception handling. Ex: catch
   ``LinAlgError: Matrix is singular.`` and report back to the user
   advice.

.. _section-7:

0.17.5
^^^^^^

-  more bugs in ``plot_covariate_groups`` fixed when using non-numeric
   strata.

.. _section-8:

0.17.4
^^^^^^

-  Fix bug in ``plot_covariate_groups`` that wasn‚Äôt allowing for strata
   to be used.
-  change name of ``multicenter_aids_cohort_study`` to
   ``load_multicenter_aids_cohort_study``
-  ``groups`` is now called ``values`` in
   ``CoxPHFitter.plot_covariate_groups``

.. _section-9:

0.17.3
^^^^^^

-  Fix in ``compute_residuals`` when using ``schoenfeld`` and the
   minumum duration has only censored subjects.

.. _section-10:

0.17.2
^^^^^^

-  Another round of serious performance improvements for the Cox models.
   Up to 2x faster for CoxPHFitter and CoxTimeVaryingFitter. This was
   mostly the result of using NumPy‚Äôs ``einsum`` to simplify a previous
   ``for`` loop. The downside is the code is more esoteric now. I‚Äôve
   added comments as necessary though ü§û

.. _section-11:

0.17.1
^^^^^^

-  adding bottleneck as a dependency. This library is highly-recommended
   by Pandas, and in lifelines we see some nice performance improvements
   with it too. (~15% for ``CoxPHFitter``)
-  There was a small bug in ``CoxPHFitter`` when using ``batch_mode``
   that was causing coefficients to deviate from their MLE value. This
   bug eluded tests, which means that it‚Äôs discrepancy was less than
   0.0001 difference. It‚Äôs fixed now, and even more accurate tests are
   added.
-  Faster ``CoxPHFitter._compute_likelihood_ratio_test()``
-  Fixes a Pandas performance warning in ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter``.
-  Performances improvements to ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter``.

.. _section-12:

0.17.0
^^^^^^

-  corrected behaviour in ``CoxPHFitter`` where ``score_`` was not being
   refreshed on every new ``fit``.
-  Reimplentation of ``AalenAdditiveFitter``. There were significant
   changes to it:

   -  implementation is at least 10x faster, and possibly up to 100x
      faster for some datasets.
   -  memory consumption is way down
   -  removed the time-varying component from ``AalenAdditiveFitter``.
      This will return in a future release.
   -  new ``print_summary``
   -  ``weights_col`` is added
   -  ``nn_cumulative_hazard`` is removed (may add back)

-  some plotting improvemnts to ``plotting.plot_lifetimes``

.. _section-13:

0.16.3
^^^^^^

-  More ``CoxPHFitter`` performance improvements. Up to a 40% reduction
   vs 0.16.2 for some datasets.

.. _section-14:

0.16.2
^^^^^^

-  Fixed ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` to allow more than one variable to be
   stratafied
-  Significant performance improvements for ``CoxPHFitter`` with dataset
   has lots of duplicate times. See
   https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/issues/591

.. _section-15:

0.16.1
^^^^^^

-  Fixed py2 division error in ``concordance`` method.

.. _section-16:

0.16.0
^^^^^^

-  Drop Python 3.4 support.
-  introduction of residual calculations in
   ``CoxPHFitter.compute_residuals``. Residuals include ‚Äúschoenfeld‚Äù,
   ‚Äúscore‚Äù, ‚Äúdelta_beta‚Äù, ‚Äúdeviance‚Äù, ‚Äúmartingale‚Äù, and
   ‚Äúscaled_schoenfeld‚Äù.
-  removes ``estimation`` namespace for fitters. Should be using
   ``from lifelines import xFitter`` now. Thanks @usmanatron
-  removes ``predict_log_hazard_relative_to_mean`` from Cox model.
   Thanks @usmanatron
-  ``StatisticalResult`` has be generalized to allow for multiple
   results (ex: from pairwise comparisons). This means a slightly
   changed API that is mostly backwards compatible. See doc string for
   how to use it.
-  ``statistics.pairwise_logrank_test`` now returns a
   ``StatisticalResult`` object instead of a nasty NxN DataFrame üíó
-  Display log(p-values) as well as p-values in ``print_summary``. Also,
   p-values below thesholds will be truncated. The orignal p-values are
   still recoverable using ``.summary``.
-  Floats ``print_summary`` is now displayed to 2 decimal points. This
   can be changed using the ``decimal`` kwarg.
-  removed ``standardized`` from ``Cox`` model plotting. It was
   confusing.
-  visual improvements to Cox models ``.plot``
-  ``print_summary`` methods accepts kwargs to also be displayed.
-  ``CoxPHFitter`` has a new human-readable method,
   ``check_assumptions``, to check the assumptions of your Cox
   proportional hazard model.
-  A new helper util to ‚Äúexpand‚Äù static datasets into long-form:
   ``lifelines.utils.to_episodic_format``.
-  ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` now accepts ``strata``.

.. _section-17:

0.15.4
^^^^^^

-  bug fix for the Cox model likelihood ratio test when using
   non-trivial weights.

.. _section-18:

0.15.3
^^^^^^

-  Only allow matplotlib less than 3.0.

.. _section-19:

0.15.2
^^^^^^

-  API changes to ``plotting.plot_lifetimes``
-  ``cluster_col`` and ``strata`` can be used together in
   ``CoxPHFitter``
-  removed ``entry`` from ``ExponentialFitter`` and ``WeibullFitter`` as
   it was doing nothing.

.. _section-20:

0.15.1
^^^^^^

-  Bug fixes for v0.15.0
-  Raise NotImplementedError if the ``robust`` flag is used in
   ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` - that‚Äôs not ready yet.

.. _section-21:

0.15.0
^^^^^^

-  adding ``robust`` params to ``CoxPHFitter``\ ‚Äôs ``fit``. This enables
   atleast i) using non-integer weights in the model (these could be
   sampling weights like IPTW), and ii) mis-specified models (ex:
   non-proportional hazards). Under the hood it‚Äôs a sandwich estimator.
   This does not handle ties, so if there are high number of ties,
   results may significantly differ from other software.
-  ``standard_errors_`` is now a property on fitted ``CoxPHFitter``
   which describes the standard errors of the coefficients.
-  ``variance_matrix_`` is now a property on fitted ``CoxPHFitter``
   which describes the variance matrix of the coefficients.
-  new criteria for convergence of ``CoxPHFitter`` and
   ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` called the Newton-decrement. Tests show it
   is as accurate (w.r.t to previous coefficients) and typically shaves
   off a single step, resulting in generally faster convergence. See
   https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/convexopt/Lecture_Slides/Newton_methods.pdf.
   Details about the Newton-decrement are added to the ``show_progress``
   statements.
-  Minimum suppport for scipy is 1.0
-  Convergence errors in models that use Newton-Rhapson methods now
   throw a ``ConvergenceError``, instead of a ``ValueError`` (the former
   is a subclass of the latter, however).
-  ``AalenAdditiveModel`` raises ``ConvergenceWarning`` instead of
   printing a warning.
-  ``KaplanMeierFitter`` now has a cumulative plot option. Example
   ``kmf.plot(invert_y_axis=True)``
-  a ``weights_col`` option has been added to ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter``
   that allows for time-varying weights.
-  ``WeibullFitter`` has a new ``show_progress`` param and additional
   information if the convergence fails.
-  ``CoxPHFitter``, ``ExponentialFitter``, ``WeibullFitter`` and
   ``CoxTimeVaryFitter`` method ``print_summary`` is updated with new
   fields.
-  ``WeibullFitter`` has renamed the incorrect ``_jacobian`` to
   ``_hessian_``.
-  ``variance_matrix_`` is now a property on fitted ``WeibullFitter``
   which describes the variance matrix of the parameters.
-  The default ``WeibullFitter().timeline`` has changed from integers
   between the min and max duration to *n* floats between the max and
   min durations, where *n* is the number of observations.
-  Performance improvements for ``CoxPHFitter`` (~20% faster)
-  Performance improvements for ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` (~100% faster)
-  In Python3, Univariate models are now serialisable with ``pickle``.
   Thanks @dwilson1988 for the contribution. For Python2, ``dill`` is
   still the preferred method.
-  ``baseline_cumulative_hazard_`` (and derivatives of that) on
   ``CoxPHFitter`` now correctly incorporate the ``weights_col``.
-  Fixed a bug in ``KaplanMeierFitter`` when late entry times lined up
   with death events. Thanks @pzivich
-  Adding ``cluster_col`` argument to ``CoxPHFitter`` so users can
   specify groups of subjects/rows that may be correlated.
-  Shifting the ‚Äúsignficance codes‚Äù for p-values down an order of
   magnitude. (Example, p-values between 0.1 and 0.05 are not noted at
   all and p-values between 0.05 and 0.1 are noted with ``.``, etc.).
   This deviates with how they are presented in other software. There is
   an argument to be made to remove p-values from lifelines altogether
   (*become the changes you want to see in the world* lol), but I worry
   that people could compute the p-values by hand incorrectly, a worse
   outcome I think. So, this is my stance. P-values between 0.1 and 0.05
   offer *very* little information, so they are removed. There is a
   growing movement in statistics to shift ‚Äúsignficant‚Äù findings to
   p-values less than 0.01 anyways.
-  New fitter for cumulative incidence of multiple risks
   ``AalenJohansenFitter``. Thanks @pzivich! See ‚ÄúMethodologic Issues
   When Estimating Risks in Pharmacoepidemiology‚Äù for a nice overview of
   the model.

.. _section-22:

0.14.6
^^^^^^

-  fix for n > 2 groups in ``multivariate_logrank_test`` (again).
-  fix bug for when ``event_observed`` column was not boolean.

.. _section-23:

0.14.5
^^^^^^

-  fix for n > 2 groups in ``multivariate_logrank_test``
-  fix weights in KaplanMeierFitter when using a pandas Series.

.. _section-24:

0.14.4
^^^^^^

-  Adds ``baseline_cumulative_hazard_`` and ``baseline_survival_`` to
   ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter``. Because of this, new prediction methods are
   available.
-  fixed a bug in ``add_covariate_to_timeline`` when using
   ``cumulative_sum`` with multiple columns.
-  Added ``Likelihood ratio test`` to ``CoxPHFitter.print_summary`` and
   ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter.print_summary``
-  New checks in ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` that check for immediate
   deaths and redundant rows.
-  New ``delay`` parameter in ``add_covariate_to_timeline``
-  removed ``two_sided_z_test`` from ``statistics``

.. _section-25:

0.14.3
^^^^^^

-  fixes a bug when subtracting or dividing two ``UnivariateFitters``
   with labels.
-  fixes an import error with using ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` predict
   methods.
-  adds a ``column`` argument to ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` and
   ``CoxPHFitter`` ``plot`` method to plot only a subset of columns.

.. _section-26:

0.14.2
^^^^^^

-  some quality of life improvements for working with
   ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` including new ``predict_`` methods.

.. _section-27:

0.14.1
^^^^^^

-  fixed bug with using weights and strata in ``CoxPHFitter``
-  fixed bug in using non-integer weights in ``KaplanMeierFitter``
-  Performance optimizations in ``CoxPHFitter`` for up to 40% faster
   completion of ``fit``.

   -  even smarter ``step_size`` calculations for iterative
      optimizations.
   -  simple code optimizations & cleanup in specific hot spots.

-  Performance optimizations in ``AalenAdditiveFitter`` for up to 50%
   faster completion of ``fit`` for large dataframes, and up to 10%
   faster for small dataframes.

.. _section-28:

0.14.0
^^^^^^

-  adding ``plot_covariate_groups`` to ``CoxPHFitter`` to visualize what
   happens to survival as we vary a covariate, all else being equal.
-  ``utils`` functions like ``qth_survival_times`` and
   ``median_survival_times`` now return the transpose of the DataFrame
   compared to previous version of lifelines. The reason for this is
   that we often treat survival curves as columns in DataFrames, and
   functions of the survival curve as index (ex:
   KaplanMeierFitter.survival_function\_ returns a survival curve *at*
   time *t*).
-  ``KaplanMeierFitter.fit`` and ``NelsonAalenFitter.fit`` accept a
   ``weights`` vector that can be used for pre-aggregated datasets. See
   this
   `issue <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/issues/396>`__.
-  Convergence errors now return a custom ``ConvergenceWarning`` instead
   of a ``RuntimeWarning``
-  New checks for complete separation in the dataset for regressions.

.. _section-29:

0.13.0
^^^^^^

-  removes ``is_significant`` and ``test_result`` from
   ``StatisticalResult``. Users can instead choose their significance
   level by comparing to ``p_value``. The string representation of this
   class has changed aswell.
-  ``CoxPHFitter`` and ``AalenAdditiveFitter`` now have a ``score_``
   property that is the concordance-index of the dataset to the fitted
   model.
-  ``CoxPHFitter`` and ``AalenAdditiveFitter`` no longer have the
   ``data`` property. It was an *almost* duplicate of the training data,
   but was causing the model to be very large when serialized.
-  Implements a new fitter ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` available under the
   ``lifelines`` namespace. This model implements the Cox model for
   time-varying covariates.
-  Utils for creating time varying datasets available in ``utils``.
-  less noisy check for complete separation.
-  removed ``datasets`` namespace from the main ``lifelines`` namespace
-  ``CoxPHFitter`` has a slightly more intelligent (barely‚Ä¶) way to pick
   a step size, so convergence should generally be faster.
-  ``CoxPHFitter.fit`` now has accepts a ``weight_col`` kwarg so one can
   pass in weights per observation. This is very useful if you have many
   subjects, and the space of covariates is not large. Thus you can
   group the same subjects together and give that observation a weight
   equal to the count. Altogether, this means a much faster regression.

.. _section-30:

0.12.0
^^^^^^

-  removes ``include_likelihood`` from ``CoxPHFitter.fit`` - it was not
   slowing things down much (empirically), and often I wanted it for
   debugging (I suppose others do too). It‚Äôs also another exit
   condition, so we many exit from the NR iterations faster.
-  added ``step_size`` param to ``CoxPHFitter.fit`` - the default is
   good, but for extremely large or small datasets this may want to be
   set manually.
-  added a warning to ``CoxPHFitter`` to check for complete seperation:
   https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faqwhat-is-complete-or-quasi-complete-separation-in-logisticprobit-regression-and-how-do-we-deal-with-them/
-  Additional functionality to ``utils.survival_table_from_events`` to
   bin the index to make the resulting table more readable.

.. _section-31:

0.11.3
^^^^^^

-  No longer support matplotlib 1.X
-  Adding ``times`` argument to ``CoxPHFitter``\ ‚Äôs
   ``predict_survival_function`` and ``predict_cumulative_hazard`` to
   predict the estimates at, instead uses the default times of
   observation or censorship.
-  More accurate prediction methods parametrics univariate models.

.. _section-32:

0.11.2
^^^^^^

-  Changing liscense to valilla MIT.
-  Speed up ``NelsonAalenFitter.fit`` considerably.

.. _section-33:

0.11.1
^^^^^^

-  Python3 fix for ``CoxPHFitter.plot``.

.. _section-34:

0.11.0
^^^^^^

-  fixes regression in ``KaplanMeierFitter.plot`` when using Seaborn and
   lifelines.
-  introduce a new ``.plot`` function to a fitted ``CoxPHFitter``
   instance. This plots the hazard coefficients and their confidence
   intervals.
-  in all plot methods, the ``ix`` kwarg has been deprecated in favour
   of a new ``loc`` kwarg. This is to align with Pandas deprecating
   ``ix``

.. _section-35:

0.10.1
^^^^^^

-  fix in internal normalization for ``CoxPHFitter`` predict methods.

.. _section-36:

0.10.0
^^^^^^

-  corrected bug that was returning the wrong baseline survival and
   hazard values in ``CoxPHFitter`` when ``normalize=True``.
-  removed ``normalize`` kwarg in ``CoxPHFitter``. This was causing lots
   of confusion for users, and added code complexity. It‚Äôs really nice
   to be able to remove it.
-  correcting column name in ``CoxPHFitter.baseline_survival_``
-  ``CoxPHFitter.baseline_cumulative_hazard_`` is always centered, to
   mimic R‚Äôs ``basehaz`` API.
-  new ``predict_log_partial_hazards`` to ``CoxPHFitter``

.. _section-37:

0.9.4
^^^^^

-  adding ``plot_loglogs`` to ``KaplanMeierFitter``
-  added a (correct) check to see if some columns in a dataset will
   cause convergence problems.
-  removing ``flat`` argument in ``plot`` methods. It was causing
   confusion. To replicate it, one can set ``ci_force_lines=True`` and
   ``show_censors=True``.
-  adding ``strata`` keyword argument to ``CoxPHFitter`` on
   initialization (ex: ``CoxPHFitter(strata=['v1', 'v2'])``. Why?
   Fitters initialized with ``strata`` can now be passed into
   ``k_fold_cross_validation``, plus it makes unit testing ``strata``
   fitters easier.
-  If using ``strata`` in ``CoxPHFitter``, access to strata specific
   baseline hazards and survival functions are available (previously it
   was a blended valie). Prediction also uses the specific baseline
   hazards/survivals.
-  performance improvements in ``CoxPHFitter`` - should see at least a
   10% speed improvement in ``fit``.

.. _section-38:

0.9.2
^^^^^

-  deprecates Pandas versions before 0.18.
-  throw an error if no admissable pairs in the c-index calculation.
   Previously a NaN was returned.

.. _section-39:

0.9.1
^^^^^

-  add two summary functions to Weibull and Exponential fitter, solves
   #224

.. _section-40:

0.9.0
^^^^^

-  new prediction function in ``CoxPHFitter``,
   ``predict_log_hazard_relative_to_mean``, that mimics what R‚Äôs
   ``predict.coxph`` does.
-  removing the ``predict`` method in CoxPHFitter and
   AalenAdditiveFitter. This is because the choice of ``predict_median``
   as a default was causing too much confusion, and no other natual
   choice as a default was available. All other ``predict_`` methods
   remain.
-  Default predict method in ``k_fold_cross_validation`` is now
   ``predict_expectation``

.. _section-41:

0.8.1
^^^^^

-  supports matplotlib 1.5.
-  introduction of a param ``nn_cumulative_hazards`` in
   AalenAdditiveModel‚Äôs ``__init__`` (default True). This parameter will
   truncate all non-negative cumulative hazards in prediction methods to
   0.
-  bug fixes including:

   -  fixed issue where the while loop in ``_newton_rhaphson`` would
      break too early causing a variable not to be set properly.
   -  scaling of smooth hazards in NelsonAalenFitter was off by a factor
      of 0.5.

.. _section-42:

0.8.0
^^^^^

-  reorganized lifelines directories:

   -  moved test files out of main directory.
   -  moved ``utils.py`` into it‚Äôs own directory.
   -  moved all estimators ``fitters`` directory.

-  added a ``at_risk`` column to the output of
   ``group_survival_table_from_events`` and
   ``survival_table_from_events``
-  added sample size and power calculations for statistical tests. See
   ``lifeline.statistics. sample_size_necessary_under_cph`` and
   ``lifelines.statistics. power_under_cph``.
-  fixed a bug when using KaplanMeierFitter for left-censored data.

.. _section-43:

0.7.1
^^^^^

-  addition of a l2 ``penalizer`` to ``CoxPHFitter``.
-  dropped Fortran implementation of efficient Python version. Lifelines
   is pure python once again!
-  addition of ``strata`` keyword argument to ``CoxPHFitter`` to allow
   for stratification of a single or set of categorical variables in
   your dataset.
-  ``datetimes_to_durations`` now accepts a list as ``na_values``, so
   multiple values can be checked.
-  fixed a bug in ``datetimes_to_durations`` where ``fill_date`` was not
   properly being applied.
-  Changed warning in ``datetimes_to_durations`` to be correct.
-  refactor each fitter into it‚Äôs own submodule. For now, the tests are
   still in the same file. This will also *not* break the API.

.. _section-44:

0.7.0
^^^^^

-  allow for multiple fitters to be passed into
   ``k_fold_cross_validation``.
-  statistical tests in ``lifelines.statistics``. now return a
   ``StatisticalResult`` object with properties like ``p_value``,
   ``test_results``, and ``summary``.
-  fixed a bug in how log-rank statistical tests are performed. The
   covariance matrix was not being correctly calculated. This resulted
   in slightly different p-values.
-  ``WeibullFitter``, ``ExponentialFitter``, ``KaplanMeierFitter`` and
   ``BreslowFlemingHarringtonFitter`` all have a
   ``conditional_time_to_event_`` property that measures the median
   duration remaining until the death event, given survival up until
   time t.

.. _section-45:

0.6.1
^^^^^

-  addition of ``median_`` property to ``WeibullFitter`` and
   ``ExponentialFitter``.
-  ``WeibullFitter`` and ``ExponentialFitter`` will use integer
   timelines instead of float provided by ``linspace``. This is so if
   your work is to sum up the survival function (for expected values or
   something similar), it‚Äôs more difficult to make a mistake.

.. _section-46:

0.6.0
^^^^^

-  Inclusion of the univariate fitters ``WeibullFitter`` and
   ``ExponentialFitter``.
-  Removing ``BayesianFitter`` from lifelines.
-  Added new penalization scheme to AalenAdditiveFitter. You can now add
   a smoothing penalizer that will try to keep subsequent values of a
   hazard curve close together. The penalizing coefficient is
   ``smoothing_penalizer``.
-  Changed ``penalizer`` keyword arg to ``coef_penalizer`` in
   AalenAdditiveFitter.
-  new ``ridge_regression`` function in ``utils.py`` to perform linear
   regression with l2 penalizer terms.
-  Matplotlib is no longer a mandatory dependency.
-  ``.predict(time)`` method on univariate fitters can now accept a
   scalar (and returns a scalar) and an iterable (and returns a numpy
   array)
-  In ``KaplanMeierFitter``, ``epsilon`` has been renamed to
   ``precision``.

.. _section-47:

0.5.1
^^^^^

-  New API for ``CoxPHFitter`` and ``AalenAdditiveFitter``: the default
   arguments for ``event_col`` and ``duration_col``. ``duration_col`` is
   now mandatory, and ``event_col`` now accepts a column, or by default,
   ``None``, which assumes all events are observed (non-censored).
-  Fix statistical tests.
-  Allow negative durations in Fitters.
-  New API in ``survival_table_from_events``: ``min_observations`` is
   replaced by ``birth_times`` (default ``None``).
-  New API in ``CoxPHFitter`` for summary: ``summary`` will return a
   dataframe with statistics, ``print_summary()`` will print the
   dataframe (plus some other statistics) in a pretty manner.
-  Adding ‚ÄúAt Risk‚Äù counts option to univariate fitter ``plot`` methods,
   ``.plot(at_risk_counts=True)``, and the function
   ``lifelines.plotting.add_at_risk_counts``.
-  Fix bug Epanechnikov kernel.

.. _section-48:

0.5.0
^^^^^

-  move testing to py.test
-  refactor tests into smaller files
-  make
   ``test_pairwise_logrank_test_with_identical_data_returns_inconclusive``
   a better test
-  add test for summary()
-  Alternate metrics can be used for ``k_fold_cross_validation``.

.. _section-49:

0.4.4
^^^^^

-  Lots of improvements to numerical stability (but something things
   still need work)
-  Additions to ``summary`` in CoxPHFitter.
-  Make all prediction methods output a DataFrame
-  Fixes bug in 1-d input not returning in CoxPHFitter
-  Lots of new tests.

.. _section-50:

0.4.3
^^^^^

-  refactoring of ``qth_survival_times``: it can now accept an iterable
   (or a scalar still) of probabilities in the q argument, and will
   return a DataFrame with these as columns. If len(q)==1 and a single
   survival function is given, will return a scalar, not a DataFrame.
   Also some good speed improvements.
-  KaplanMeierFitter and NelsonAalenFitter now have a ``_label``
   property that is passed in during the fit.
-  KaplanMeierFitter/NelsonAalenFitter‚Äôs inital ``alpha`` value is
   overwritten if a new ``alpha`` value is passed in during the ``fit``.
-  New method for KaplanMeierFitter: ``conditional_time_to``. This
   returns a DataFrame of the estimate: med(S(t \| T>s)) - s, human
   readable: the estimated time left of living, given an individual is
   aged s.
-  Adds option ``include_likelihood`` to CoxPHFitter fit method to save
   the final log-likelihood value.

.. _section-51:

0.4.2
^^^^^

-  Massive speed improvements to CoxPHFitter.
-  Additional prediction method: ``predict_percentile`` is available on
   CoxPHFitter and AalenAdditiveFitter. Given a percentile, p, this
   function returns the value t such that *S(t \| x) = p*. It is a
   generalization of ``predict_median``.
-  Additional kwargs in ``k_fold_cross_validation`` that will accept
   different prediction methods (default is ``predict_median``).
-  Bug fix in CoxPHFitter ``predict_expectation`` function.
-  Correct spelling mistake in newton-rhapson algorithm.
-  ``datasets`` now contains functions for generating the respective
   datasets, ex: ``generate_waltons_dataset``.
-  Bumping up the number of samples in statistical tests to prevent them
   from failing so often (this a stop-gap)
-  pep8 everything

.. _section-52:

0.4.1.1
^^^^^^^

-  Ability to specify default printing in statsitical tests with the
   ``suppress_print`` keyword argument (default False).
-  For the multivariate log rank test, the inverse step has been
   replaced with the generalized inverse. This seems to be what other
   packages use.
-  Adding more robust cross validation scheme based on issue #67.
-  fixing ``regression_dataset`` in ``datasets``.

.. _section-53:

0.4.1
^^^^^

-  ``CoxFitter`` is now known as ``CoxPHFitter``
-  refactoring some tests that used redundant data from
   ``lifelines.datasets``.
-  Adding cross validation: in ``utils`` is a new
   ``k_fold_cross_validation`` for model selection in regression
   problems.
-  Change CoxPHFitter‚Äôs fit method‚Äôs ``display_output`` to ``False``.
-  fixing bug in CoxPHFitter‚Äôs ``_compute_baseline_hazard`` that errored
   when sending Series objects to ``survival_table_from_events``.
-  CoxPHFitter‚Äôs ``fit`` now looks to columns with too low variance, and
   halts NR algorithm if a NaN is found.
-  Adding a Changelog.
-  more sanitizing for the statistical tests =)

.. _section-54:

0.4.0
^^^^^

-  ``CoxFitter`` implements Cox Proportional Hazards model in lifelines.
-  lifelines moves the wheels distributions.
-  tests in the ``statistics`` module now prints the summary (and still
   return the regular values)
-  new ``BaseFitter`` class is inherited from all fitters.
