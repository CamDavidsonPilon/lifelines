Questions about survival analysis?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using lifelines for survival analysis and have a question
about “how do I do X?” or “what does Y do?”, the best place to ask that
is either in our `gitter
channel <https://gitter.im/python-lifelines/Lobby>`__ or at
`stats.stackexchange.com <https://stats.stackexchange.com/>`__.

Submitting bugs or other errors observed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We appreciate all bug reports submitted, as this will help the entire
community get a better product. Please open up an issue in the Github
Repository. If possible, please provide a code snippet, and what version
of lifelines you are using.

Submitting new feature requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please open up an issue in the Github Repository with as much context as
possible about the feature you would like to see. Also useful is to link
to other libraries/software that have that feature.

Submitting code, or other changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are interested in contributing to lifelines (and we thank you for
the interest!), we recommend first opening up an issue in the GitHub
repository to discuss the changes. From there, we can together plan how
to execute the changes. See the Development section below for how to
setup a local environment.

Development
-----------

Setting up a lifelines development environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the root directory of ``lifelines`` activate your `virtual
   environment <https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/>`__
   (if you plan to use one).
2. Install the development requirements and
   `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`__ hooks. If you are on Mac,
   Linux, or `Windows
   WSL <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq>`__ you can
   use the provided
   `Makefile <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/blob/master/Makefile>`__.
   Just type ``make`` into the console and you’re ready to start
   developing. This will also install the dev-requirements.

Formatting
~~~~~~~~~~

``lifelines`` uses the `black <https://github.com/ambv/black>`__
python formatter. There are 3 different ways to format your code.

1. Use the
   `Makefile <https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/blob/master/Makefile>`__.

    ``make lint``

2. Call ``black`` directly and pass the correct line
   length.

    ``black . -l 120``

3. Have your code formatted automatically
   during commit with the ``pre-commit`` hook.

   * Stage and commit your unformatted changes:

      ``git commit -m "your_commit_message"``

   * Code that needs to be formatted will “fail” the commit hooks and be
     formatted for you.
   * Stage the newly formatted python code:

      ``git add *.py``

   * Recall your original commit command and commit again:

      ``git commit -m "your_commit_message"``

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can optionally run the test suite after install with

 ``py.test``
