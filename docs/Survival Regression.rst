Survival Regression
=====================================

Often we have additional data aside from the duration, and if
applicable any censorships that occurred. In the previous section's regime dataset, we have
the type of government the political leader was part of, the country
they were head of, and the year they were elected. Can we use this data
in survival analysis?

Yes, the technique is called *survival regression* -- the name implies
we regress covariates (e.g., age, country, etc.) against
another variable -- in this case durations. Similar to the
logic in the first part of this tutorial, we cannot use traditional
methods like linear regression.

There are two popular techniques in survival regression: Cox's
model and Aalen's additive model. Both models attempt to represent the
hazard rate :math:`h(t | x)` as a function of :math:`t` and some covariates :math:`x`. We explore these models next. 


Cox's proportional hazard model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

lifelines has an implementation of the Cox proportional hazards regression model (implemented in
R as ``coxph``). The idea behind the model is that the log-hazard of an individual is a linear function of their static covariates *and* a population-level baseline hazard that changes over time. Mathematically:

.. math::  \underbrace{h(t | x)}_{\text{hazard}} = \overbrace{b_0(t)}^{\text{baseline hazard}} \underbrace{\exp \overbrace{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n b_i (x_i - \overline{x_i})\right)}^{\text{log-partial hazard}}}_ {\text{partial hazard}}

Note a few facts about this model: the only time component is in the baseline hazard, :math:`b_0(t)`. In the above product, the partial hazard is a time-invariant scalar factor that only increases or decreases the baseline hazard. Thus a changes in covariates will only increase or decrease the baseline hazard.

The dataset for regression
###########################
The dataset required for survival regression must be in the format of a Pandas DataFrame. Each row of the DataFrame should be an observation. There should be a column denoting the durations of the observations. There may be a column denoting the event status of each observation (1 if event occured, 0 if censored). There are also the additional covariates you wish to regress against. Optionally, there could be columns in the DataFrame that are used for stratification, weights, and clusters which will be discussed later in this tutorial. 

.. note:: In other regression models, a column of 1s might be added that represents that intercept or baseline. This is not necessary in the Cox model. In fact, there is no intercept in the additive Cox model - the baseline hazard represents this. _lifelines_ will will throw warnings and may experience convergence errors if a column of 1s is present in your dataset.

An example dataset is called the Rossi recidivism dataset, available in lifelines as ``datasets.load_rossi``.

.. code:: python

    from lifelines.datasets import load_rossi

    rossi = load_rossi()

    """
         week  arrest  fin  age  race  wexp  mar  paro  prio
    0      20       1    0   27     1     0    0     1     3
    1      17       1    0   18     1     0    0     1     8
    2      25       1    0   19     0     1    0     1    13
    3      52       0    1   23     1     1    1     1     1
    """

The dataframe ``rossi`` contains 432 observations. The ``week`` column is the duration, the ``arrest`` column is the event occured, and the other columns represent variables we wish to regress against. 


If you need to first clean or transform your dataset (encode categorical variables, add interation terms, etc.), that should happen *before* using lifelines. Libraries like Pandas and Patsy help with that. 


Running the regression
########################


The implementation of the Cox model in lifelines is called ``CoxPHFitter``. Like R, it has a ``print_summary`` function that prints a tabular view of coefficients and related stats.


.. code:: python

    from lifelines import CoxPHFitter
    from lifelines.datasets import load_rossi

    rossi_dataset = load_rossi()
    
    cph = CoxPHFitter()
    cph.fit(rossi_dataset, duration_col='week', event_col='arrest', show_progress=True)

    cph.print_summary()  # access the results using cph.summary

    """

To access the coefficients and the baseline hazard directly, you can use ``cph.hazards_`` and ``cph.baseline_hazard_`` respectively.


Convergence
###########################################

Fitting the Cox model to the data involves using gradient descent. Lifelines takes extra effort to help with convergence, so please be attentive to any warnings that appear. Fixing any warnings will generally help convergence. If you wish to see the fitting, there is a ``show_progress`` parameter in ``CoxPHFitter.fit`` function. For further help, see :ref:`Problems with convergence in the Cox Proportional Hazard Model`.

After fitting, the value of the maximum log-likelihood this available using ``cph._log_likelihood``. Similarly, the score and Hessian matrix are available under ``_score_`` and ``_hessian_`` respectively.


Goodness of fit
###########################################

After fitting, you may want to know how "good" of a fit your model was to the data. Aside from traditional approaches, two methods the author has found useful is to 1. look at the concordance-index (see below section on :ref:`Model Selection in Survival Regression`), available as ``cph.score_`` or in the ``print_summary`` and 2. compare spread between the baseline survival function vs the Kaplan Meier survival function (Why? Interpret the spread as how much "variance" is provided by the baseline hazard versus the partial hazard. The baseline hazard is approximately equal to the Kaplan-Meier curve if none of the variance is explained by the covariates / partial hazard. Deviations from this provide a visual measure of variance explained). For example, the first figure below is a good fit, and the second figure is a much weaker fit.

.. image:: images/goodfit.png

.. image:: images/badfit.png


Prediction
###########################################


After fitting, you can use use the suite of prediction methods: ``.predict_partial_hazard``, ``.predict_survival_function``, etc.

.. code:: python

    X = rossi_dataset.drop(["week", "arrest"], axis=1)
    
    cph.predict_partial_hazard(X)

    cph.predict_survival_function(X, times=[5., 25., 50.])

    cph.predict_median(X)


A common use case is to predict the event time of censored subjects. This is easy to do, but we first have to calculate an important conditional probability. Let :math:`T` be the (random) event time for some subject, and :math:`S(t)â‰”P(T > t)` be their surival function. We are interested to know *What is the new survival function, given I know the subject has lived past time s, where s < t?* Mathmematically:

.. math:: 

    \begin{align*}
    P(T > t \;|\; T > s) &= \frac{P(T > t \;\text{and}\; T > s)}{P(T > s)} \\
                         &= \frac{P(T > t)}{P(T > s)} \\ 
                         &= \frac{S(t)}{S(s)}
    \end{align*}

Thus we scale the original survival function by the survival function at time :math:`s` (everything prior to :math:`s` should be mapped to 1.0 as well, since we are working with probabilities and we know that the subject was alive before :math:`s`). 

Back to our original problem of predicting the event time of censored individuals, we do the same thing:

.. code:: python

    from lifelines import CoxPHFitter
    from lifelines.datasets import load_regression_dataset
    
    df = load_regression_dataset()
    
    cph = CoxPHFitter().fit(df, 'T', 'E')
    
    censored_subjects = df.loc[df['E'] == 0]
    
    unconditioned_sf = cph.predict_survival_function(censored_subjects)
    
    conditioned_sf = unconditioned_sf.apply(lambda c: (c / c.loc[df.loc[c.name, 'T']]).clip_upper(1))

    # let's focus on a single subject
    subject = 13
    unconditioned_sf[subject].plot(ls="--", color="#A60628", label="unconditioned")
    conditioned_sf[subject].plot(color="#A60628", label="conditioned on $T>10$")
    plt.legend()


.. image:: images/survival_regression_conditioning.png


From here, you can pick a median or percentile as a best guess as to the subject's event time:

.. code:: python


    from lifelines.utils import median_survival_times, qth_survival_times

    predictions_50 = median_survival_times(conditioned_sf)
    predictions_75 = qth_survival_times(0.75, conditioned_sf)


    # plotting subject 13 again
    plt.hlines([0.5, 0.75], 0, 23, alpha=0.5, label="percentiles")

    plt.scatter(median_survival_times(conditioned_sf[subject]), 0.5,  color="#E24A33", label="median prediction", zorder=20)
    plt.scatter(qth_survival_times(0.75, conditioned_sf[subject]), 0.75,  color="#467821", label="q=75 prediction", zorder=20)

    plt.legend()


.. image:: images/survival_regression_conditioning_with_median.png


Plotting the coefficients
###########################################

With a fitted model, an alternative way to view the coefficients and their ranges is to use the ``plot`` method.

.. code:: python

    from lifelines.datasets import load_rossi
    from lifelines import CoxPHFitter

    rossi_dataset = load_rossi()
    cph = CoxPHFitter()
    cph.fit(rossi_dataset, duration_col='week', event_col='arrest', show_progress=True)

    cph.plot()

.. image:: images/coxph_plot.png


Plotting the effect of varying a covariate
#############################################

After fitting, we can plot what the survival curves look like as we vary a single covarite while
holding everything else equal. This is useful to understand the impact of a covariate, *given the model*. To do this, we use the ``plot_covariate_groups`` method and give it the covariate of interest, and the values to display.

.. code:: python

    from lifelines.datasets import load_rossi
    from lifelines import CoxPHFitter

    rossi_dataset = load_rossi()
    cph = CoxPHFitter()
    cph.fit(rossi_dataset, duration_col='week', event_col='arrest', show_progress=True)

    cph.plot_covariate_groups('prio', [0, 5, 10, 15])

.. image:: images/coxph_plot_covarite_groups.png


Checking the proportional hazards assumption
#############################################

``CoxPHFitter`` has a ``check_assumptions`` method that will output violations of the proportional hazard assumption. For a tutorial on how to fix violations, see `Testing the Proportional Hazard Assumptions`_.


Non-proportional hazards is a case of *model misspecification*. Suggestions are to look for ways to *stratify* a column (see docs below), or use a time-varying model (see docs much further below).


Stratification
################

Sometimes one or more covariates may not obey the proportional hazard assumption. In this case, we can allow the covariate(s) to still be including in the model without estimating its effect. This is called stratification. At a high level, think of it as splitting the dataset into *N* smaller datasets, defined by the unique values of the stratifing covariate(s). Each dataset has its own baseline hazard (the non-parametric part of the model), but they all share the regression parameters (the parametric part of the model). Since covariates are the same within each dataset, there is no regression parameter for the covariates stratified on, hence they will not show up in the output. However there will be *N* baseline hazards under ``baseline_cumulative_hazard_``.

To specify variables to be used in stratification, we define them in the call to ``fit``:

.. code:: python

    from lifelines.datasets import load_rossi
    from lifelines import CoxPHFitter

    rossi_dataset = load_rossi()
    cph = CoxPHFitter()
    cph.fit(rossi_dataset, 'week', event_col='arrest', strata=['race'], show_progress=True)

    cph.print_summary()  # access the results using cph.summary

Weights & Robust Errors
########################

Observations can come with weights, as well. These weights may be integer values representing some commonly occuring observation, or they may be float values representing some sampling weights (ex: inverse probability weights). In the ``CoxPHFitter.fit`` method, an kwarg is present for specifying which column in the dataframe should be used as weights, ex: ``CoxPHFitter(df, 'T', 'E', weights_col='weights')``.

When using sampling weights, it's correct to also change the standard error calculations. That is done by turning on the ``robust`` flag in ``fit``. Interally, ``CoxPHFitter`` will use the sandwhich estimator to compute the errors. 


.. code:: python

    from lifelines import CoxPHFitter

    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'T': [5, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7],
        'E': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
        'weights': [1.1, 0.5, 2.0, 1.6, 1.2, 4.3, 1.4, 4.5, 3.0, 3.2, 0.4, 6.2],
        'month': [10, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7],
        'age': [4, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7],
    })

    cph = CoxPHFitter()
    cph.fit(df, 'T', 'E', weights_col='weights', robust=True)
    cph.print_summary()

See more examples in _`Adding weights to observations in a Cox model`. 

Clusters & Correlations
##########################

Another property your dataset may have is groups of related subjects. This could be caused by:

 - a single individual having multiple occurrences, and hence showing up in the dataset more than once. 
 - subjects that share some common property, like members of the same family or being matched on prospensity scores. 

We call these grouped subjects "clusters", and assume they are designated by some column in the dataframe (example below). When using clustesr, the point estimates of the model don't change, but the standard errors will increase. An intuitive argument for this is that 100 observations on 100 individuals provide more information than 100 observations on 10 individuals (or clusters). 


.. code:: python

    from lifelines import CoxPHFitter

    df = pd.DataFrame({
        'T': [5, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7],
        'E': [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
        'month': [10, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7],
        'age': [4, 3, 9, 8, 7, 4, 4, 3, 2, 5, 6, 7],
        'id': [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    })

    cph = CoxPHFitter()
    cph.fit(df, 'T', 'E', cluster_col='id')
    cph.print_summary()


For more examples, see _`Correlations between subjects in a Cox model`.

Residuals
##########################

After fitting a Cox model, we can look back and compute important model residuals. These residuals can tell us about non-linearities not captured, violations of proportional hazards, and help us answer other useful modelling questions. See `Assessing Cox model fit using residuals`_.

Aalen's Additive model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: This implementation is still experimental.

.. note:: This API of this model changed in version 0.17.0

Aalen's Additive model is another regression model we can use. Like the Cox model, it defines 
the hazard rate, but instead of the linear model being multiplicative like the Cox model, the Aalen model is 
additive. Specifically:


.. math:: 
    h(t|x)  = b_0(t) + b_1(t) x_1 + ... + b_N(t) x_N


Inference typically does not estimate the individual
:math:`b_i(t)` but instead estimates :math:`\int_0^t b_i(s) \; ds`
(similar to the estimate of the hazard rate using ``NelsonAalenFitter``). This is important
when interpreting plots produced.  


For this
exercise, we will use the regime dataset and include the categorical
variables ``un_continent_name`` (eg: Asia, North America,...), the
``regime`` type (e.g., monarchy, civilian,...) and the year the regime
started in, ``start_year``. The estimator to fit unknown coefficients in Aalen's additive model is
located under ``lifelines.AalenAdditiveFitter``.

I'm using the lovely library `patsy <https://github.com/pydata/patsy>`__ here to create a
design matrix from my original dataframe.

.. code:: python

    import patsy
    X = patsy.dmatrix('un_continent_name + regime + start_year', data, return_type='dataframe')
    X = X.rename(columns={'Intercept': 'baseline'})

    print(X.columns.tolist())


.. parsed-literal::

  ['baseline',
   'un_continent_name[T.Americas]',
   'un_continent_name[T.Asia]',
   'un_continent_name[T.Europe]',
   'un_continent_name[T.Oceania]',
   'regime[T.Military Dict]',
   'regime[T.Mixed Dem]',
   'regime[T.Monarchy]',
   'regime[T.Parliamentary Dem]',
   'regime[T.Presidential Dem]',
   'start_year']


We have also included the ``coef_penalizer`` option. During the estimation, a
linear regression is computed at each step. Often the regression can be
unstable (due to high
co-linearity or small sample sizes) -- adding a penalizer term controls the stability. I recommend always starting with a small penalizer term -- if the estimates still appear to be too unstable, try increasing it.

.. code:: python

    aaf = AalenAdditiveFitter(coef_penalizer=1.0, fit_intercept=False)

An instance of ``AalenAdditiveFitter``
includes a ``fit`` method that performs the inference on the coefficients. This method accepts a pandas DataFrame: each row is an individual and columns are the covariates and
two individual columns: a *duration* column and a boolean *event occurred* column (where event occurred refers to the event of interest - expulsion from government in this case)


.. code:: python

    X['T'] = data['duration']
    X['E'] = data['observed']


.. code:: python

    aaf.fit(X, 'T', event_col='E')


After fitting, the instance exposes a ``cumulative_hazards_`` DataFrame
containing the estimates of :math:`\int_0^t b_i(s) \; ds`:

.. code:: python

    aaf.cumulative_hazards_.head()

``AalenAdditiveFitter`` also has built in plotting:

.. code:: python

  aaf.plot(columns=['regime[T.Presidential Dem]', 'baseline', 'un_continent_name[T.Europe]'], iloc=slice(1,15))


.. image:: images/survival_regression_aaf.png


Regression is most interesting if we use it on data we have not yet
seen, i.e., prediction! We can use what we have learned to predict
individual hazard rates, survival functions, and median survival time.
The dataset we are using is available up until 2008, so let's use this data to
predict the duration of former Canadian
Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

.. code:: python

    ix = (data['ctryname'] == 'Canada') & (data['start_year'] == 2006)
    harper = X.loc[ix]
    print("Harper's unique data point:")
    print(harper)

.. parsed-literal::

    Harper's unique data point:
         baseline  un_continent_name[T.Americas]  un_continent_name[T.Asia] ...  start_year  T  E
    268       1.0                            1.0                        0.0 ...      2006.0  3  0


.. code:: python

    ax = plt.subplot(2,1,1)
    aaf.predict_cumulative_hazard(harper).plot(ax=ax)

    ax = plt.subplot(2,1,2)
    aaf.predict_survival_function(harper).plot(ax=ax);


.. image:: images/survival_regression_harper.png

.. warning:: Because of the nature of the model, estimated survival functions of individuals can increase. This is an expected artifact of Aalen's additive model.



Cox's Time Varying Proportional Hazard model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. warning:: This implementation is still experimental.

Often an individual will have a covariate change over time. An example of this is hospital patients who enter the study and, at some future time, may recieve a heart transplant. We would like to know the effect of the transplant, but we cannot condition on whether they recieved the transplant naively. Consider that if patients needed to wait at least 1 year before getting a transplant, then everyone who dies before that year is considered as a non-transplant patient, and hence this would overestimate the hazard of not recieving a transplant.

We can incorporate changes over time into our survival analysis by using a modification of the Cox model above. The general mathematical description is:

.. math::  h(t | x) = \overbrace{b_0(t)}^{\text{baseline}}\underbrace{\exp \overbrace{\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \beta_i (x_i(t) - \overline{x_i}) \right)}^{\text{log-partial hazard}}}_ {\text{partial hazard}}

Note the time-varying :math:`x_i(t)` to denote that covariates can change over time. This model is implemented in lifelines as ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter``. The dataset schema required is different than previous models, so we will spend some time describing this.

Dataset creation for time-varying regression
#############################################

Lifelines requires that the dataset be in what is called the *long* format. This looks like one row per state change, including an ID, the left (exclusive) time point, and right (inclusive) time point. For example, the following dataset tracks three unique subjects.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-height:1000px;max-width:1500px;overflow:auto;">
      <table border="1" class="dataframe">
        <thead>
          <tr style="text-align: right;">

            <th style="padding:8px;">stop</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">group</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">z</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">event</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">8</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">False</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">2</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">5</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">False</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">2</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">5</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">8</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">True</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">3</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">3</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">False</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">3</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">3</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">12</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">True</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>5 rows Ã— 6 columns</p>
    </div>

In the above dataset, ``start`` and ``stop`` denote the boundaries, ``id`` is the unique identifier per subject, and ``event`` denotes if the subject died at the end of that period. For example, subject ID 2 had variable ``z=0`` up to and including the end of time period 5 (we can think that measurements happen at end of the time period), after which it was set to 1. Since ``event`` is 1 in that row, we conclude that the subject died at time 8,

This desired dataset can be built up from smaller datasets. To do this we can use some helper functions provided in lifelines. Typically, data will be in a format that looks like it comes out of a relational database. You may have a "base" table with ids, durations alive, and a censorsed flag, and possibly static covariates. Ex:

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-height:1000px;max-width:1500px;overflow:auto;">
      <table border="1" class="dataframe">
        <thead>
          <tr style="text-align: right;">
            <th style="padding:8px;">id</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">duration</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">event</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">var1</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">10</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">True</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0.1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">2</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">12</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">False</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0.5</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>2 rows Ã— 4 columns</p>
    </div>

We will perform a light transform to this dataset to modify it into the "long" format.

.. code:: python

      from lifelines.utils import to_long_format

      base_df = to_long_format(base_df, duration_col="duration")

The new dataset looks like:


.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-height:1000px;max-width:1500px;overflow:auto;">
      <table border="1" class="dataframe">
        <thead>
          <tr style="text-align: right;">
            <th style="padding:8px;">id</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">start</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">stop</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">var1</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">event</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">10</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0.1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">True</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">2</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">12</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0.5</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">False</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>2 rows Ã— 5 columns</p>
    </div>



You'll also have secondary dataset that references future measurements. This could come in two "types". The first is when you have a variable that changes over time (ex: administering varying medication over time, or taking a tempature over time). The second types is an event-based dataset: an event happens at some time in the future (ex: an organ transplant occurs, or an intervention). We will address this second type later. The first type of dataset may look something like:

Example:

.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-height:1000px;max-width:1500px;overflow:auto;">
      <table border="1" class="dataframe">
        <thead>
          <tr style="text-align: right;">
            <th style="padding:8px;">id</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">time</th>
            <th style="padding:8px;">var2</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1.4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">4</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1.2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">8</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1.5</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">2</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1.6</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>4 rows Ã— 3 columns</p>
    </div>

where ``time`` is the duration from the entry event. Here we see subject 1 had a change in their ``var2`` covariate at the end of time 4 and at the end of time 8. We can use ``add_covariate_to_timeline`` to fold the covariate dataset into the original dataset.


.. code:: python

      from lifelines.utils import add_covariate_to_timeline

      df = add_covariate_to_timeline(base_df, cv, duration_col="time", id_col="id", event_col="event")


.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-height:1000px;max-width:1500px;overflow:auto;">
      <table border="1" class="dataframe">
        <thead>
          <tr style="text-align: right;">
            <th style="padding: 8px;">id</th>

            <th style="padding: 8px;">stop</th>
            <th style="padding: 8px;">var1</th>
            <th style="padding: 8px;">var2</th>
            <th style="padding: 8px;">event</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">4</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0.1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1.4</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">False</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">4</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">8</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0.1</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1.2</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">False</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

            <td style="padding: 8px;">1.5</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">True</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">2</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">12</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">0.5</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">1.6</td>
            <td style="padding: 8px;">False</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>4 rows Ã— 6 columns</p>
    </div>

From the above output, we can see that subject 1 changed state twice over the observation period, finally expiring at the end of time 10. Subject 2 was a censored case, and we lost track of them after time 12.

You may have multiple covariates you wish to add, so the above could be streamlined like so:

.. code:: python

      from lifelines.utils import add_covariate_to_timeline

      df = base_df.pipe(add_covariate_to_timeline, cv1, duration_col="time", id_col="id", event_col="event")\
                  .pipe(add_covariate_to_timeline, cv2, duration_col="time", id_col="id", event_col="event")\
                  .pipe(add_covariate_to_timeline, cv3, duration_col="time", id_col="id", event_col="event")


If your dataset is of the second type, that is, event-based, your dataset may look something like the following, where values in the matrix denote times since the subject's birth, and ``None`` or  ``NaN`` represent the event not happening (subjects can be excluded if the event never occurred as well) :

.. code-block:: python

    print(event_df)


        id    E1
    0   1     1.0
    1   2     NaN
    2   3     3.0
    ...

Initially, this can't be added to our baseline dataframe. However, using ``utils.covariates_from_event_matrix`` we can convert a dataframe like this into one that can be easily added.


.. code-block:: python

    from lifelines.utils import covariates_from_event_matrix

    cv = covariates_from_event_matrix(event_df, id_col="id")
    print(cv)


    event  id  duration  E1
    0       1       1.0   1
    1       3       3.0   1
    ...


    base_df = add_covariate_to_timeline(base_df, cv, duration_col="time", id_col="id", event_col="E")

For an example of pulling datasets like this from a SQL-store, and other helper functions, see :ref:`Example SQL queries and transformations to get time varying data`.

Cumulative sums
#############################################

One additional flag on ``add_covariate_to_timeline`` that is of interest is the ``cumulative_sum`` flag. By default it is False, but turning it to True will perform a cumulative sum on the covariate before joining. This is useful if the covariates describe an incremental change, instead of a state update. For example, we may have measurements of drugs administered to a patient, and we want the covariate to reflect how much we have administered since the start. Event columns do make sense to cumulative sum as well. In contrast, a covariate to measure the temperature of the patient is a state update, and should not be summed.  See :ref:`Example cumulative total using and time-varying covariates` to see an example of this.

Delaying time-varying covariates
#############################################

``add_covariate_to_timeline`` also has an option for delaying, or shifting, a covariate so it changes later than originally observed. One may ask, why should one delay a time-varying covariate? Here's an example. Consider investigating the impact of smoking on mortality and available to us are time-varying observations of how many cigarettes are consumed each month. Unbeknownst to us, when a subject reaches critical illness levels, they are admitted to the hospital and their cigarette consumption drops to zero. Some expire while in hospital. If we used this dataset naively, we would see that not smoking leads to sudden death, and conversely, smoking helps your health! This is a case of reverse causation: the upcoming death event actually influences the covariates.

To handle this, you can delay the observations by time periods:

Fitting the model
################################################

Once your dataset is in the correct orientation, we can use ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` to fit the model to your data. The method is similar to ``CoxPHFitter``, expect we need to tell the ``fit`` about the additional time columns.

Fitting the Cox model to the data involves using gradient descent. Lifelines takes extra effort to help with convergence, so please be attentive to any warnings that appear. Fixing any warnings will generally help convergence. For further help, see :ref:`Problems with convergence in the Cox Proportional Hazard Model`.


.. code:: python

    from lifelines import CoxTimeVaryingFitter

    ctv = CoxTimeVaryingFitter()
    ctv.fit(df, id_col="id", event_col="event", start_col="start", stop_col="stop", show_progress=True)
    ctv.print_summary()
    ctv.plot()


Short note on prediction
################################################

Unlike the other regression models, prediction in a time-varying setting is not trivial. To predict, we would need to know the covariates values beyond the observed times, but if we knew that, we would also know if the subject was still alive or not! However, it is still possible to compute the hazard values of subjects at known observations, the baseline cumulative hazard rate, and baseline survival function. So while ``CoxTimeVaryingFitter`` exposes prediction methods, there are logicial limitations to what these predictions mean.



Model Selection in Survival Regression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Model selection based on residuals
################################################

The sections `Testing the Proportional Hazard Assumptions`_ and `Assessing Cox model fit using residuals`_ may be useful for modelling your data better.


Model selection based on predictive power
################################################

If censorship is present, it's not appropriate to use a loss function like mean-squared-error or
mean-absolute-loss. Instead, one measure is the concordance-index, also known as the c-index. This measure
evaluates the accuracy of the ordering of predicted time. It is infact a generalization
of AUC, another common loss function, and is interpreted similarly:

* 0.5 is the expected result from random predictions,
* 1.0 is perfect concordance and,
* 0.0 is perfect anti-concordance (multiply predictions with -1 to get 1.0)

A fitted model's concordance-index is present in the ``print_summary()``, but also available under the ``score_`` property. Generally, the measure is implemented in lifelines under ``lifelines.utils.concordance_index`` and accepts the actual times (along with any censorships) and the predicted times.

.. code:: python

    from lifelines import CoxPHFitter
    from lifelines.datasets import load_rossi

    rossi = load_rossi()

    cph = CoxPHFitter()
    cph.fit(rossi, duration_col="week", event_col="arrest")

    # method one
    cph.print_summary()

    # method two
    print(cph.score_)

    # method three
    from lifelines.utils import concordance_index
    print(concordance_index(rossi['week'], -cph.predict_partial_hazard(rossi).values, rossi['arrest']))


However, there are other, arguably better, methods to measure the fit of a model. Included in `print_summary` is the log-likelihood, which can be used in an `AIC calculation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion>`_, and the `log-likelihood ratio statistic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test>`_. Generally, I personally loved this article by Frank Harrell, `"Statistically Efficient Ways to Quantify Added Predictive Value of New Measurements" <http://www.fharrell.com/post/addvalue/>`_.


Lifelines has an implementation of k-fold cross validation under ``lifelines.utils.k_fold_cross_validation``. This function accepts an instance of a regression fitter (either ``CoxPHFitter`` of ``AalenAdditiveFitter``), a dataset, plus `k` (the number of folds to perform, default 5). On each fold, it splits the data
into a training set and a testing set fits itself on the training set and evaluates itself on the testing set (using the concordance measure).

.. code:: python

        from lifelines import CoxPHFitter
        from lifelines.datasets import load_regression_dataset
        from lifelines.utils import k_fold_cross_validation

        regression_dataset = load_regression_dataset()
        cph = CoxPHFitter()
        scores = k_fold_cross_validation(cph, regression_dataset, 'T', event_col='E', k=3)
        print(scores)
        print(np.mean(scores))
        print(np.std(scores))
