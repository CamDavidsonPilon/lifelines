    "### Checking assumptions with `check_assumptions`\n",
    "\n",
    "New to lifelines 0.16.0 is the `CoxPHFitter.check_assumptions` method. This method will compute statistics that check the proportional hazard assumption, produce plots to check assumptions, and more. Also included is an option to display advice to the console. Here's a breakdown of each information displayed:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Presented first are the results of a statistical test to test for any time-varying coefficients. A time-varying coefficient imply a covariate's influence _relative to the baseline_ changes over time. This implies a violation of the proportional hazard assumption. For each variable, we transform _time_ four times (these are common transformations of time to perform). If _lifelines_ rejects the null (that is, _lifelines_ rejects that the coefficient is not time-varying), we report this to the user.\n",
    " - Some advice is presented on how to correct the proportional hazard violation based on some summary statistics of the variable. \n",
    " - As a compliment to the above statistical test, for each variable that violates the PH assumption, visual plots of the the _scaled Schoenfeld residuals_ is presented against the four time transformations. A fitted lowess is also presented, along with 10 bootstrapped lowess lines (as an approximation to the confidence interval of the original lowess line). Ideally, this lowess line is constant (flat). Deviations away from the constant line are violations of the PH assumption. \n",
    " \n",
    "####  Why the _scaled Schoenfeld residuals_?\n",
    " \n",
    "This section can be skipped on first read. Let $s_{t,j}$ denote the scaled Schoenfeld residuals of variable $j$ at time $t$, $\\hat{\\beta_j}$ denote the maximum-likelihood estimate of the $j$th variable, and $\\beta_j(t)$ a time-varying coefficient in (fictional) alternative model that allows for time-varying coefficients. Therneau and Grambsch showed that. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[s_{t,j}] + \\hat{\\beta_j} = \\beta_j(t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportional hazard assumption implies that $\\hat{\\beta_j} = \\beta_j(t)$, hence $E[s_{t,j}] = 0$. This is what the above proportional hazard test is testing. Visually, plotting $s_{t,j}$ over time (or some transform of time), is a good way to see violations of $E[s_{t,j}] = 0$, along with the statisical test. "

If these baseline hazards are _very_ different, then clearly the formula above is wrong - the $h(t)$ is some weighted average of the subgroups' baseline hazards.

On the other hand, with tiny bins, we allow the `age` data to have the most \"wiggle room\", but must compute many baseline hazards each of which has a smaller sample size. Like most things, the optimial value is somewhere inbetween."
