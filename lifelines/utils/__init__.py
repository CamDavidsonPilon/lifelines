    Joins multiple event series together into dataframes. A generalization of

        groups: a (n,) array of individuals' group ids.
        durations: a (n,)  array of durations of each individual

    # Here's how this works.
    #
    # It would be pretty easy to do if we had no censored data and no ties. There, the basic idea
    # would be to iterate over the cases in order of their true event time (from least to greatest),
    # while keeping track of a pool of *predicted* event times for all cases previously seen (= all
    # cases that we know should be ranked lower than the case we're looking at currently).
    #
    # If the pool has O(log n) insert and O(log n) RANK (i.e., "how many things in the pool have
    # value less than x"), then the following algorithm is n log n:
    #
    # Sort the times and predictions by time, increasing
    # n_pairs, n_correct := 0
    # pool := {}
    # for each prediction p:
    #     n_pairs += len(pool)
    #     n_correct += rank(pool, p)
    #     add p to pool
    #
    # There are three complications: tied ground truth values, tied predictions, and censored
    # observations.
    #
    # - To handle tied true event times, we modify the inner loop to work in *batches* of observations
    # p_1, ..., p_n whose true event times are tied, and then add them all to the pool
    # simultaneously at the end.
    #
    # - To handle tied predictions, which should each count for 0.5, we switch to
    #     n_correct += min_rank(pool, p)
    #     n_tied += count(pool, p)
    #
    # - To handle censored observations, we handle each batch of tied, censored observations just
    # after the batch of observations that died at the same time (since those censored observations
    # are comparable all the observations that died at the same time or previously). However, we do
    # NOT add them to the pool at the end, because they are NOT comparable with any observations
