[What is survival analysis and why should I learn it?](http://lifelines.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Survival%20Analysis%20intro.html)
 Survival analysis was originally developed and applied heavily by the actuarial and medical community. Its purpose was to answer *why do events occur now versus later* under uncertainty (where *events* might refer to deaths, disease remission, etc.). This is great for researchers who are interested in measuring lifetimes: they can answer questions like *what factors might influence deaths?*

But outside of medicine and actuarial science, there are many other interesting and exciting applications of this
lesser-known technique, for example:
- SaaS providers are interested in measuring customer lifetimes, or time to first behaviours
- sociologists are interested in measuring political parties' lifetimes, or relationships, or marriages
- analysing [Godwin's law](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukashalim/GODWIN/master/Kaplan-Meier-Godwin.png) in Reddit comments
- A/B tests to determine how long it takes different groups to perform an action.

*lifelines* is a pure Python implementation of the best parts of survival analysis. We'd love to hear if you are using *lifelines*, please leave an Issue and let us know your thoughts on the library.

## Installation:

You can install *lifelines* using

       pip install lifelines


Or getting the bleeding edge version with:

       pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines.git

from the command line.

##### Installation Issues?

See the common [problems/solutions for installing lifelines](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Ainstallation+).

#### Running the tests

You can optionally run the test suite after install with

    py.test


## lifelines Documentation and an intro to survival analysis

If you are new to survival analysis, wondering why it is useful, or are interested in *lifelines* examples, API, and syntax,
please check out the [Documentation and Tutorials page](http://lifelines.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)

Example:
```python
from lifelines import KaplanMeierFitter

durations = [11, 74, 71, 76, 28, 92, 89, 48, 90, 39, 63, 36, 54, 64, 34, 73, 94, 37, 56, 76]
event_observed = [ True,  True, False,  True,  True,  True,  True, False, False,True, True,
  True,  True,  True,  True,  True, False,  True, False,  True]

kmf = KaplanMeierFitter()
kmf.fit(durations, event_observed)
kmf.plot()
```
