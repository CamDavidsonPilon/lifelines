[What is survival analysis and why should I learn it?](http://lifelines.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Survival%20Analysis%20intro.html)
 Survival analysis was originally developed and applied heavily by the actuarial and medical community. Its purpose was to answer *why do events occur now versus later* under uncertainty (where *events* might refer to deaths, disease remission, etc.). This is great for researchers who are interested in measuring lifetimes: they can answer questions like *what factors might influence deaths?*

But outside of medicine and actuarial science, there are many other interesting and exciting applications of this
lesser-known technique, for example:
- SaaS providers are interested in measuring customer lifetimes, or time to first behaviours
- sociologists are interested in measuring political parties' lifetimes, or relationships, or marriages
- businesses are interested in what variables affect lifetime value

*lifelines* is a pure Python implementation of the best parts of survival analysis. We'd love to hear if you are using *lifelines*, please leave an Issue and let us know your thoughts on the library.

### Installation:


#### Dependencies:

The usual Python data stack: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas (a modern version please), Matplotlib

#### Installing

You can install *lifelines* using

       pip install lifelines


Or getting the bleeding edge version with:

       pip install --upgrade --no-deps git+https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifelines.git


from the command line.

#### Running the tests

You can optionally run the test suite after install with

    python -m lifelines.tests
