Tips for the Twitter Dataset:

# data.txt
This file contains 10,000 densely crawled cascades, every single tweet has its timestamp(sec) and the number of follower of the user. Shown as below:
###########
0 3
84833 4682
84878 20
84883 3
###########
the original tweet of this cascade starts from 0, and the user has 3 followers. Then his friend retweet it after 82833 seconds, and his number of follower is 4682, etc. Every new cascade start from 0.

# index.txt
Every line in index.txt records a cascade, about the time(within 24 hours), the begining line and the ending line in data.txt, shown as below:
#########
0.9266435190000001 1 175
2.68159722 176 369
#########
THe first cascade starts from 0.9266... at one day, and in data.txt, we record it from line 1 ~ line 175. In the same manner, we find the second cascade start from 2.681... at one day, and we record it from line 176 to line 369 in data.txt.
